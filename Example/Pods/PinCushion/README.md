## Example

PinCushion is a lightweight UIView extension in Swift 4 intended to clean up NSLayoutConstraint code. PinCushion attempts to use the same vocabulary that Interface Builder visually uses.

For example to add a width constraint to a view, all you need is `view.pin(.width, constant:50.0)` and your view is now constrained to a width of 50 points.

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

Swift 4
iOS 8.0 and above

## Installation

PinCushion is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'PinCushion'
```
